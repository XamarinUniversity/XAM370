        <h2>Duration</h2>
        <p>10 minutes</p>

        <h2>Goals</h2>
        <p>
            In this final demonstration, we will test the memory utilization differences between the built-in <code>ArrayAdapter</code> and a custom data adapter for Android.
        </p>

        <h2>Assets</h2>
        <p>
            The provided <strong>Exercise 5</strong> folder contains a sub-folder named <strong>Start</strong> with a pre-built Xamarin.Android application which we will use to try this out.
        </p>

        <!-- Steps -->
        <h1>Steps</h1>
        <p>
            Below are the step-by-step instructions.
        </p>

        <h2>Run the starter application and determine the memory utilization</h2>
        <p>
        Let's start by familiarizing ourselves with the starter solution.
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>Open the <b>EmailCLient.sln</b> solution in the <b>Exercise 5</b> folder.
            </li>
            <li>
            Run the application to see what it does. It should display 500 emails in a <code>ListView</code>.
            </li>

            <img src="./res/images/part5-start.png" />

            <li>
                Tapping an item in the list will display details about it. And there's an icon in the toolbar to force a GC like the other apps. Check the debug window to see the details.
            </li>

</pre>

            <li>
            In this case, we don't have a memory leak, but the use of <code>ArrayAdapter</code> in our code is forcing the two GCs to have to spend more time working on cleaning up objects and walking the created graph.
            </li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Switch to a custom adapter</h2>
        <p>
        Next, lets switch to a custom adapter and see how it changes the memory utilization. The code for the adapter has already been provided in the <b>EmailItemAdapter.cs</b> source file.
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>Open the <b>MainActivity.cs</b> source file and comment out the current <code>ListAdapter</code> property setter.</li>
            <li>
                Add a new setter for the same property, but assign it to a new instance of the <code>EmailItemAdapter</code> custom class. Feel free to open the source file and examine the implementation.
            </li>
            <li>
            Run the app again and get the same GC stats and compare them to the originals.
            </li>

            <li>
            The total memory space isn't terribly different - but that's not a big surprise, <code>string</code>s are optimized between the two platforms and that's mostly what's being shared here. But notice the number of objects in the <b>GC_OLD_BRIDGE</b> statement - the Java class uses quite a few more, and these are the objects which have to be tracked and walked between the two engines. This accounts for the timing differences as well - notice that our custom adapter spent <em>less time</em> doing the GC - almost a full millisecond less! That may not seem like much, but it adds up, and we'd see this begin to multiply more as we add more data, or if we run it on a lower-end Android device.
            </li>
        </ol>

        <h1>Summary</h1>
        <p>
            In this exercise, we compared the built-in <code>ArrayAdapter</code> approach to a custom <code>ListView</code> adapter to see how it potentially improves our performance and memory utilization by reducing the number of Java objects.
