        <h1 id="page-title"></h1>

        <h2>Duration</h2>
        <p>5 minutes</p>

        <h2>Goals</h2>
        <p>
            In this group exercise, we will identify a case where a framework peer promotion causes a memory leak in a Xamarin.iOS application.
        </p>

        <h2>Assets</h2>
        <p>
            The provided <strong>Exercise 4</strong> folder contains a sub-folder named <strong>Start</strong> with a pre-built Xamarin.iOS application which has a reference cycle in it due to a framework peer promotion.
        </p>

        <!-- Steps -->
        <h1>Steps</h1>
        <p>
            Below are the step-by-step instructions to find and fix the reference cycle.
        </p>

        <h2>Run the application to see the issue</h2>
        <p>
        Let's start by familiarizing ourselves with the starter solution.
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>Open the <b>PeerPromotion.sln</b> solution.
            </li>
            <li>
            Run the application to see what it does. It should show a screen with a purple button and a GC trash icon in the toolbar:
            </li>

            <img src="./res/images/part4-start.png" style='border:1px solid #999999' />

            <li>
                If you press the button, it will display a second screen using a navigation controller. You will also see output in the debug window related to the creation of the screen.
            </li>

            <img src="./res/images/part4-slider.png" style='border:1px solid #999999' />

            <li>
            Using the slider will update the label.
            </li>
            
            <li>
            Go back to the previous screen by tapping the Back button.
            </li>

            <li>
                Tapping the trash can icon will perform a GC. Notice that the child view is <em>not</em> being destroyed.
            </li>        

            <li>
                Navigate to and from the child view a few times - you should see the counter continuing to increase but it never goes down; we're leaking the child screen each time. However this leak is <em>not</em> due to a direct parent/child relationship!
            </li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Explore the source code</h2>
        <p>
        Next, lets look at the code for the application to see if we can identify the issue.
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Expand the solution contents.
                <ul class="indent-none">
                    <li>It has a main <code>MainViewController</code>. which provides the first screen you interact with.</li>
                    <li>It has a <b>ViewController.cs</b> which contains the child view.
                </ul>
            </li>

            <li>
                The <b>ViewController.cs</b> class is the child view which is not being cleaned up properly. Notice that it outputs the creation and destruction as part of the constructor and <code>Dispose</code> method.
            </li>

            <li>
                In this case, the leak might not be as obvious as earlier examples. But look at the event handler we are wiring up on the slider. Notice we are using a lambda here, but the lambda accesses state in the view controller - that means it will have a reference to the <code>ValueLabel</code> object as part of the handler - ultimately we are creating a reference cycle here, we just can't see it.
            </li>
            
        </ol>

        <h2>Approaches to fixing the leak.</h2>
        <p>
            As before, there are a few ways we could fix this:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>
            We could catch when the view is being shown and dismissed and connect and disconnect the event handler (<code>ViewDidAppear</code> and <code>ViewDidDisappear</code>). This means we have to use a standard method handler instead of a lambda.
            </li>

            <li>
            We could use the Storyboard designer to create the event handler. In this case, it uses the underlying action message to connect up the event rather than a .NET event handler - so no reference cycle is created.
            </li>

            <li>
            Pick one of these approaches and run the app again and verify that this solves the problem.
            </li>
        </ol>

        <h1>Summary</h1>
        <p>
            In this exercise, we fixed a framework peer promotion issue which caused a circular reference through an event handler. Check the completed solution in <b>Exercise 4</b> if you want to see the final code.
